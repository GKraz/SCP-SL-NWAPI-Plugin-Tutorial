Welcome to my SCP:SL Plugin Creation Guide! (by DMFGames)

THIS IS NOT A PLUGIN DO PUT THIS IN AN SCP:SL SERVER!!!

1.  To start, create a new project in your desired IDE/Coding Environment.
    -   You will be creating a .Net Framework Class Library
    -   .Net Framework version 4.8 is required. (.Net Framework v4.8)
    
2.  Open your new project; it is time to add dependencies.
    These are found here: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server\SCPSL_Data"
    (You will need to have the "SCP: Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server" installed on Steam.)
    -   Assembly-CSharp.dll
    -   PluginAPI.dll
    
    More dlls can be added for anything needed for your plugin. The ones listed are the only ones used for the examples.
    
3. Move onto the next section, "2. Basic Example"
